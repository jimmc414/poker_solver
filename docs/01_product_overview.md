# GTO Wizard: Product Overview

## Executive Summary

GTO Wizard is the world's leading poker training and strategy platform, providing cloud-based access to Game Theory Optimal (GTO) solutions, real-time AI-powered custom solving, interactive training tools, hand history analysis, and competitive play. It serves as an all-in-one platform for poker players ranging from casual beginners to professional grinders, replacing what previously required multiple separate software tools with a single integrated product.

The platform combines a library of over 10 million precomputed solver solutions with a proprietary neural network engine (GTO Wizard AI, powered by Ruse AI technology) that generates custom strategies in seconds. This dual approach -- instant access to a massive solution database plus real-time custom solving for any scenario -- is unique in the poker software market and forms the foundation of GTO Wizard's market dominance.

---

## Company Background

GTO Wizard was founded by a team of poker players and software engineers who recognized a gap in the market: existing poker solvers were powerful but inaccessible. Desktop tools like PioSolver required expensive hardware, technical expertise, and hours of computation per scenario. There was no integrated platform that combined solving, training, analysis, and study into a single accessible product.

The company launched as a cloud-based poker strategy platform, initially offering precomputed GTO solutions through a web interface. This approach eliminated hardware requirements and made solver-quality strategy accessible to any player with a browser. The platform's solution library -- covering cash games, tournaments, Spin & Go, and heads-up formats -- grew rapidly, eventually surpassing 10 million presolved spots.

A pivotal moment came in 2023 with the acquisition of Ruse AI, a poker AI technology developed by Philippe Beardsell and Marc-Antoine Provost from Mila (Quebec's AI research laboratory). This technology, combining neural networks with traditional Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), became the engine behind GTO Wizard AI -- enabling real-time custom solving that was previously impossible in a cloud environment.

The leadership team includes CTO Viktor Stiskala, whose background in Python, Django, and web infrastructure shaped the platform's cloud-first architecture. The engineering team maintains a public GitHub organization (gtowizard-ai) and has participated in academic poker AI competitions (MIT Poker 2024), reflecting the company's research-oriented culture.

## Market Position

### Why GTO Wizard is the #1 Poker Training Application

GTO Wizard achieved market leadership through a combination of timing, product breadth, and continuous innovation.

**Timing and Market Fit.** The platform launched when the poker solver market was dominated by desktop-only tools that required technical knowledge and powerful hardware. By offering a cloud-based, beginner-friendly alternative with instant results, GTO Wizard captured the large segment of players who found traditional solvers intimidating or inaccessible.

**Product-Led Growth.** A free tier creates a discovery funnel. Daily quizzes and study plans create habitual engagement. PokerArena provides free competitive play that drives brand awareness. Affiliate programs and a partnership with GGPoker (including live broadcast analysis integration) expand reach into professional and recreational communities.

**Comprehensive Feature Set.** No single competitor matches GTO Wizard's breadth. Players who previously needed PioSolver (solving) + PokerTracker (hand analysis) + a training site (practice) + study materials (education) can now use one platform for everything.

**Continuous Innovation.** Monthly feature releases -- 3-way solving, Nodelocking 2.0, custom profiles, multiway preflop, GTO Reports, PokerArena, Table Wizard -- keep the product ahead of competitors who update less frequently.

### User Base and Reach

GTO Wizard supports **17 languages**, reflecting a global user base. The platform is accessible via web browser (Progressive Web App), dedicated iOS applications (PokerArena and GTO Preflop Wizard), and a native Windows desktop application (Table Wizard). This multi-platform presence ensures accessibility across devices and regions.

The integration with GGPoker for live broadcast analysis -- displaying real-time GTO strategy overlays during poker streams like GGMillion$ final tables -- provides brand visibility to millions of poker viewers.

## Core Value Proposition

GTO Wizard's value proposition rests on four pillars:

1. **Accessibility**: Cloud-based with zero hardware requirements. Any browser, any device, any skill level. No installation, no configuration, no waiting for solves.

2. **Comprehensiveness**: The complete Study-Practice-Analyze-Compete workflow in one platform. Study solver solutions, practice against GTO opponents, analyze your real hands, and compete against other players -- all integrated.

3. **Accuracy**: Precomputed solutions at 0.1--0.3% Nash Distance. GTO Wizard AI custom solutions averaging 0.12% Nash Distance (the lowest reported exploitability of any cloud solver). Validated by defeating Slumbot at 19.4 bb/100 over 150,000 hands.

4. **Speed**: Precomputed solutions load instantly. Custom AI solutions generate in approximately 3 seconds per street. What takes PioSolver hours, GTO Wizard AI delivers in seconds.

## Key Differentiators vs. Competition

The poker solver market contains two categories of tools: calculator-type solvers (PioSolver, GTO+, MonkerSolver, TexasSolver) that run custom calculations, and database/library-type solvers (Deepsolver, GTOBase, PokerSnowie) that provide pre-solved or rapidly computed solutions. GTO Wizard uniquely bridges both categories. For a detailed competitive analysis, see [Competitive Landscape](13_competitive_landscape.md).

| Differentiator | GTO Wizard | Competitors |
|---------------|------------|-------------|
| **All-in-one platform** | Study + Practice + Analyze + Compete | Single-purpose tools |
| **Hardware requirements** | None (cloud) | PioSolver: 16+ cores, 128 GB RAM; MonkerSolver: 64+ GB RAM |
| **Pre-solved library** | 10M+ spots, instant access | No pre-solved library (compute on demand) |
| **Custom solving speed** | ~3 seconds/street | Minutes to hours |
| **Format coverage** | Cash, MTT, Spin & Go, HU SNG, Straddle+Ante | Typically 1-2 formats |
| **Mobile access** | Full PWA + iOS apps | Desktop only (except PokerSnowie) |
| **Integrated training** | Advanced trainer, Range Builder, drills | Basic or none |
| **Hand analysis** | 17+ poker site formats, automated classification | Not available |
| **Tournament/ICM** | Full ICM, PKO, satellite, mystery bounty, 50K+ FT sims | Limited or none |
| **Multiway solving** | 3-way postflop, 9-player preflop | Limited or intractable |
| **Price model** | Subscription ($39-$129/mo) | One-time ($75-$549) or subscription |

The primary tradeoff is cost: desktop solvers like GTO+ ($75 one-time) and PioSolver Pro ($249 one-time) are dramatically cheaper over time. GTO Wizard's subscription model costs more long-term but provides ongoing updates, cloud access, training tools, and hand analysis that desktop solvers lack entirely.

## Technology Foundation

GTO Wizard's technical architecture combines two complementary solving paradigms. For full details, see [Solver Engine](02_solver_engine.md) and [Architecture Blueprint](14_architecture_blueprint.md).

### Precomputed Solutions (CFR)

The platform maintains a library of over 10 million precomputed postflop solutions generated by running traditional Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) to convergence. These solutions target 0.1--0.3% Nash Distance and cover multiple game formats, stack depths, preflop action sequences, and board textures. Solutions are stored as compressed lookup tables and served with aggressive CDN caching for instant response times.

### GTO Wizard AI (Neural Network + CFR Hybrid)

The real-time solver, powered by Ruse AI technology acquired in 2023, uses a fundamentally different approach: depth-limited solving with neural network value prediction. Rather than computing the full game tree from a position to all terminal nodes, the AI solves one street at a time, using neural networks trained through hundreds of millions of hands of self-play to estimate the value of game states beyond the current street.

This approach enables:
- Strategies generated in ~3 seconds per street (vs. hours for traditional solvers)
- Only 2 CPU cores and 8 GB RAM required (vs. 16+ cores and 128+ GB RAM)
- Dynamic bet sizing that captures 99.95% of available river EV
- Abstraction-free solving (no hand bucketing or information loss)
- Multiway support (up to 3 players postflop)

In April 2025, the engine was upgraded to use Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) instead of Nash Equilibrium for custom solutions, reducing average flop exploitability by 25% (from 0.165% to 0.12% of pot) and solving the "ghostline problem" where zero-frequency decision nodes received poor optimization.

### Hand Evaluator

A C++ hand evaluator achieves 400 million random hand evaluations per second on a single thread, supporting the solver pipeline and real-time gameplay simulation.

## Feature Suite Overview

GTO Wizard's features span five major categories. Each is documented in detail in the referenced documents.

### Study Mode ([Doc 03](03_study_mode.md))

The primary analytical workspace for exploring precomputed GTO solutions. Four interconnected tabs -- Strategy, Ranges, Breakdown, and Reports -- provide different lenses for examining equilibrium data. The Strategy tab displays a 13x13 hand grid with color-coded action frequencies. The Ranges tab compares both players' ranges. The Breakdown tab reveals the composition of each betting action. The Reports tab provides aggregate data across all 1,755 strategically distinct flops.

### Practice Mode ([Doc 04](04_practice_mode.md))

An interactive training environment with three game modes (Full Hand, Street, Spot), three difficulty levels (Simple, Grouped, Standard), multitabling support (1-4 tables), and a scoring system (GTOW Score from -100% to +100%). Players compete against the solver's equilibrium strategy with immediate feedback, EV loss calculations, and comprehensive session analytics. A five-level mastery framework guides progressive skill development.

### Analyze Mode ([Doc 05](05_analyze_mode.md))

A hand history analyzer supporting 17+ online poker sites. Players upload hand histories (single hands or entire databases), and the system compares every decision against GTO solutions. Each decision is classified as Best, Correct, Inaccuracy, Mistake, or Blunder with precise EV loss calculations. Analyzer 2.0 provides performance dashboards with breakdowns by position, street, action type, and date range.

### GTO Wizard AI ([Doc 06](06_gto_wizard_ai.md))

The real-time custom solver with full parameter control: stack sizes, pot sizes, ranges, bet sizing (Automatic, Dynamic, or Fixed), rake structures, and more. Supports 3-way solving, nodelocking for exploitative analysis, and saves/organizes solutions with a tagging system. Available exclusively to Elite tier subscribers ($129/month).

### Nodelocking ([Doc 07](07_nodelocking.md))

A system for modeling opponent deviations from GTO and computing optimal counter-strategies. The three-tab interface (Set Strategy, Set Frequency, Lock/Unlock) enables users to define opponent tendencies, lock strategies at specific nodes, and observe the solver's exploitative response. Nodelocking 2.0 added enhanced multi-node locking, improved frequency calculations, and integration with 3-way solving.

### Aggregated Reports ([Doc 08](08_aggregated_reports.md))

Macro-level strategy analysis across all 1,755 strategically distinct flop subsets. Standard reports use the precomputed library; custom reports (powered by GTO Wizard AI) allow full parameter customization. Reports measure strategy frequencies, EV, equity, and equity realization, with filtering by board texture, suit composition, pairing, and connectedness. Custom reports require Power Credits.

### Tournament Strategy (ICM, PKO, Bounties) ([Doc 09](09_tournament_icm.md))

Comprehensive tournament solving including ICM calculations, bubble factor analysis, PKO bounty modeling, mystery bounty support, and satellite strategy. Over 50,000 precomputed ICM final table simulations for 200-player tournaments. Custom ICM solving via GTO Wizard AI for any heads-up postflop tournament situation. The platform accounts for the non-linear chip value that fundamentally distinguishes tournament play from cash games.

### Range Builder ([Doc 10](10_range_builder.md))

An active learning tool for practicing range construction. Players build their entire strategy for a spot -- assigning actions and frequencies to every hand -- then the system grades against GTO. Supports paintbrush tools, suit-specific strategies, combo locking, and integration with Study Mode and Practice Mode.

### PokerArena ([Doc 11](11_ui_ux_screens.md))

A competitive heads-up poker mode with ranked play, seasonal leaderboards, casual matches, and friend challenges. Available on desktop, mobile browser, and iOS app with full crossplay. Free to play; deep post-game analysis requires a GTO Wizard subscription.

### Table Wizard ([Doc 11](11_ui_ux_screens.md))

A native Windows desktop application for managing multiple online poker tables simultaneously. Provides real-time overlays showing bets, raises, and calls; hotkey support; custom bet sliders; and automatic hand history upload to Analyzer 2.0 after each hand.
